# SQL query folder
I have included two scripts here to use for generating the CSV files.

Add more scripts if you have specific data you want to see from the database.

* solar_vs_Grid_vs_Home_use.sql
   * This script will generate the total lifetime energy, energy generated since last script run, and current power reading for the consumption and production meters on the PVS.  
   * It will also calculate total home consumption energy and home consumption since last poll.


* individual_solar_panel_generation.sql
  * Generates the total lifetime energy and current power reading as of reporting timestamp
